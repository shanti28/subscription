Title: Payment Successful! 
----

Text: A successful charge was created. You can specify whether SCK just updates the page with text to say the charge was successful, or redirect to another page. 

If a payment is declined, this is reported to the customer within Checkout immediately. Give it a try by using the test card `4000 0000 0000 0002` instead.
